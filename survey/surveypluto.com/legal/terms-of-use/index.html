Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals, you are not permitted to use and/or purchase any paid Services from SurveyPluto. You will ensure
that: (a) your end users do not use the Services in violation of any export restriction or embargo by the United States; and (b) you do not provide access
to the Services to persons or entities on any of the above lists.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">9. Acceptable Uses Policy</h3>
<p class="cut-2">You agree to comply with the Acceptable Uses Policy.</p>
<h3 class="title-2">10. PCI Compliance</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
We are responsible for keeping your Cardholder Data secure. If you use our Services to accept credit card payments, then you must comply with the Payment
Card Industry Data Security Standards.
</p>
<h4 class="title-3">10.1 PCI Standards.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">
If you use the Services to accept payment card transactions, you must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) to the
extent they are applicable to your business (the "PCI Standards"). SurveyPluto provides tools to simplify your compliance with the PCI Standards, but you
must ensure that your business is compliant and the specific steps you will need to take to comply with the PCI Standards will depend on your
implementation of the Services.
</p>
<h4 class="title-3">10.2 Cardholder Data.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">
SurveyPluto is responsible for the security of Cardholder Data that is collected, transmitted, stored, or processed by us on your behalf. "Cardholder
Data" is defined as a cardholder's primary account number, and where a full unmasked card number is present, any of the cardholder name, expiration date,
and/or service code. SurveyPluto has developed strict security features to protect Cardholder Data, and as such this data may only be used in anticipated
ways and stored in appropriate places. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE PROHIBITED FROM COLLECTING OR ENTERING CARDHOLDER DATA INTO ANY FORM OR DATA
ENTRY FIELDS IN THE SERVICES, EXCEPT INTO THOSE FIELDS INTENDED SOLELY FOR THAT PURPOSE (i.e. where SurveyPluto explicitly enables such data to be entered
into such fields). Appropriate fields are clearly marked with labels such as 'Card number' or by having a credit card icon precede them. Similarly,
excluding payment forms, you must never collect or enter any "Sensitive Authentication Data", as defined by the PCI Standards (including CVC or CVV2) into
any fields in the Services. You assume all responsibility for any Cardholder Data entered into the Services in violation of these terms.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">11. Suspension, Account Closure, and Termination of Services</h3>
<p class="cut-2">Here is how you can close your account with us and how we may suspend or disable your account and/or terminate the Services.</p>
<h4 class="title-3">11.1 By You.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">
You can cancel your Subscription immediately through your account management page. We do not offer refunds except under very limited circumstances.
</p>
<p class="cut-2">
You can cancel your Subscription and/or close your account at any time through your account management page. When you close your account, your
Subscription will automatically be cancelled, your Services will be terminated, and you will no longer be able to access your account to use the Services
and your Content will be deleted in accordance with our data retention policy and these TOU. You can obtain a copy of your Content from the relevant
Service(s) before closing your account, subject to applicable law and policies. Alternatively, you can delete your Content yourself proactively prior to
cancelling a Subscription and closing your account. If you would like to cancel your Subscription without closing your account, see Section 1.2 for
further information. When you close your account, we will provide you with confirmation of account closure and Subscription cancellation, and you will not
be charged again for that Subscription unless you open a new account and purchase a new Subscription. If you cancel a Subscription in the middle of a
billing cycle, you will not receive a refund unless you are canceling for any of the following reasons: (a) we have materially breached these Terms and
failed to cure that breach within 30 days after you have so notified us in writing; (b) a refund is required by law; or (c) we, in our sole discretion,
determine a refund is appropriate. For clarity, we will not grant a refund where you have used our Services, collected responses, and/or downloaded your
responses unless the termination is due to our material, uncured breach or a refund is required by law.
</p>
<p class="cut-2">
Nothing in this Section 11.1 shall exclude or limit any rights which you may have if you are considered a consumer in your country of residence. For
example, if you qualify as a consumer in the European Union you may have certain refund and withdrawal rights as described in our European Union
Subscription Cancellation Policy. You may also have a right of refund or a right to terminate in respect of the EU Legal Warranty. See our
Country-Specific Terms for Europe for more information.
</p>
<h4 class="title-3">11.2 By SurveyPluto.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">
(a) For Convenience. SurveyPluto may cancel your Subscription and terminate the Services effective at the end of a billing cycle by providing at least 30
days' prior written notice to you without refund for any prior period. Additionally, SurveyPluto may cancel your Subscription and terminate the Services
at any time during the billing cycle by providing at least 90 days' written notice to you and will provide a pro rata refund for any period of time you
did not use the relevant Service(s) in that billing cycle.
</p>
<p class="cut-2">
(b) For Cause. SurveyPluto may limit, disable, suspend and/or cancel your Subscription and terminate the Services and/or close your account for any of the
following reasons: (a) you have materially breached these Terms and failed to cure that breach within 30 days after SurveyPluto has so notified you in
writing; (b) you cease your business operations or become subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within 90 days; (c) you
fail to pay fees for past the due date; (d) you use the Services in a way that causes legal liability to us or disrupts others' use of the Services; (e)
if we are investigating suspected misconduct by you, including illegal activity; or (f) we are required to do so to comply with applicable law. If we
limit, disable, suspend and/or cancel your Subscription and/or terminate the Services, depending upon the reason, we will, where possible, endeavor to
give you advance notice and an opportunity to obtain a copy of your Content from that Service. However, there may be time sensitive situations where
SurveyPluto may decide that we need to take immediate action without notice. SurveyPluto will use commercially reasonable efforts to narrow the scope and
duration of any limitation or suspension under this Section as is needed to resolve the issue that prompted such action. Except as set out in our Privacy
Notice, and as may be required under applicable law, SurveyPluto has no obligation to retain your Content upon closure of your account.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">12. Downgrades.</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
Downgrading your account plan (changing your Subscription type, or cancelling a Subscription and downgrading to our SurveyPluto Free Version) may cause
the loss of Content, features, functionality, or capacity of your account.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">13. Disclaimers, Limitations of Liability, and Indemnification</h3>
<p class="cut-2">Our Services will perform and function as described in these Terms.</p>
<h4 class="title-3">13.1 Disclaimers.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">
While it is in SurveyPluto's interest to provide you with a great experience when using the Services, there are certain things we do not promise about
them. We try to keep our online Services up, but they may be unavailable from time to time for various reasons. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE
TERMS AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICES AND ANY GUIDANCE OR RECOMMENDATIONS THEREIN ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND SurveyPluto DOES
NOT MAKE WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT OR ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING AVAILABILITY, RELIABILITY, OR ACCURACY OF THE SERVICES.
</p>
<h4 class="title-3">13.2 Exclusion of Certain Liability.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SurveyPluto (INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS AND THEIR OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, AND LICENSORS)
WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, OR (B) LOSS OF USE, DATA,
BUSINESS, REVENUES, OR PROFITS (IN EACH CASE WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT), ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES AND THESE TERMS, AND WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF SurveyPluto HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF
A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
</p>
<h4 class="title-3">13.3 Limitation of Liability.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">In the event of a dispute, we won't owe more than the amount you've paid or should have paid in the previous 12 months for the Services</p>
<p class="cut-2">
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF SurveyPluto (INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS AND THEIR OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,
SUPPLIERS, AND LICENSORS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES AND THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF: (A) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO
SurveyPluto FOR USE OF THE SERVICES AT ISSUE DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.
</p>
<p class="cut-2">
IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE ABOVE TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS (SECTION 13.2) AND/OR LIMITATIONS (SECTION 13.3) ARE NOT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY
FOR YOUR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE ALL REASONABLE SKILL AND CARE OR THAT DIRECTLY RESULT FROM A
MATERIAL BREACH OF THESE TERMS.
</p>
<h4 class="title-3">13.4 Indemnification.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">
If we get sued because of something you do using our Services or because you violate these Terms, we expect that you will step into our shoes to defend
that lawsuit and pay any damages awarded by the Court.
</p>
<p class="cut-2">
You will indemnify and hold harmless SurveyPluto (including its affiliates and its and their officers, agents, and employees) from all liabilities,
damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of a third party claim regarding or in connection with your or
your end users' use of the Services or breach of these Terms, to the extent that such liabilities, damages and costs were caused by you or your end users.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">14. Other Terms</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
You may not transfer these obligations to someone else without our permission. However, we can transfer these terms or our obligations without your
permission.
</p>
<h4 class="title-3">14.1 Assignment.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">
You may not assign these Terms without SurveyPluto's prior written consent, which may be withheld in SurveyPluto's sole discretion. SurveyPluto may assign
these Terms at any time without notice to you.
</p>
<h4 class="title-3">14.2 Customer Lists.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">
We can use your name, logo, and description of how you use our Services on our website, in earnings calls, and in marketing and promotional materials.
</p>
<p class="cut-2">
SurveyPluto may identify you by name and logo as a customer of the Services on our websites and on other promotional materials. Any goodwill arising from
the use of your name and logo will inure to your benefit.
</p>
<h4 class="title-3">14.3 Entire Agreement.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">
These TOU are the only set of terms that govern our relationship. Any additional terms (like those in tiny font attached to the bottom of a purchase
order) that you provide will not be binding.
</p>
<p class="cut-2">
These Terms (including the Additional Terms) constitute the entire agreement between you and SurveyPluto, and they supersede any other prior or
contemporaneous agreements, terms and conditions, written or oral concerning its subject matter. Any terms and conditions appearing on a purchase order or
similar document issued by you, or in your procurement, invoicing, or vendor onboarding portal do not apply to the Services, do not override or form a
part of these Terms, and are void.
</p>
<h4 class="title-3">14.4 Independent Contractors.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">
The relationship between you and SurveyPluto is that of independent contractors, and not legal partners, employees, or agents of each other.
</p>
<h4 class="title-3">14.5 Interpretation.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">The use of the terms "includes", "including", "such as", and similar terms, will be deemed not to limit what else might be included.</p>
<h4 class="title-3">14.6 Language.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">
These Terms are prepared and written in English. To the extent that any translated version conflicts with the English version, the English version
controls, except where prohibited by applicable law.
</p>
<h4 class="title-3">14.7 No Waiver.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">A party's failure or delay to enforce a provision under these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later.</p>
<h4 class="title-3">14.8 Severability.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">If any part of these Terms is not enforceable, the rest of the Terms will still be enforceable.</p>
<p class="cut-2">
If any provision of these Terms is determined to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be severed and the remainder
of terms will remain in full effect.
</p>
<h4 class="title-3">14.9 Third Party Beneficiaries.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms.</p>
<h4 class="title-3">14.10 Survival.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">Some terms live on even after this TOU ends.</p>
<h3 class="title-2">15. Terms for Certain Customers</h3>
<p class="cut-2">Some of these additional terms may apply depending on which Services you use.</p>
<h4 class="title-3">15.1 Customer-Specific Terms.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">
We may amend and modify the relevant terms of this Agreement at any time, and you may review the latest version of the Terms of Service on the relevant
service page. If you do not agree to the changed terms, you may stop login the account and use the services; if you continue to log in the account or use
the services provided by us, you have accepted all the revised terms. In case of any dispute with us, the latest terms of the User Service Agreement shall
prevail.
</p>
<h4 class="title-3">15.2 email address.</h4>
<p class="cut-2">Unless otherwise, any notification sent to us should be email to <span class="surveypluto-com"><a href="https://surveypluto.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3e515858575d575f527e4d4b4c485b474e524b4a51105d5153">[email&#160;protected]</a></span></p>
