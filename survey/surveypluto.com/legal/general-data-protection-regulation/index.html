<h1>GDPR</h1>
<p class="cut-1">
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect on May 25, 2018. It addresses the vast changes
which have taken place in the tech arena over the
past two decades and seeks to harmonise the approach to data protection matters across Europe by
establishing a single set of pan-European rules.It
replaces the Data Protection Directive which has been law across the European Union for the past 20 years.
At SurveyPluto, we don't see GDPR as just a
legal obligation or another compliance box to tick. Rather, we're excited to help our customers understand
how we're approaching this change. When the
European Data Protection Directive was introduced in 1995, the law makers were addressing the risks posed to
personal data that existed during the
formation and early years of the Internet. In order to ensure that the protection of personal data remains a
fundamental right for EU citizens the aim of
GDPR is to modernise outdated, and unfit for purpose privacy laws.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">Why is GDPR so important?</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
The impact of GDPR is significant as it affects any business that collects data in Europe (whether they are
based in Europe or not). It has effectively
introduced the first global privacy standard. GDPR puts a greater weight of responsibility on individuals
and organisations whose businesses involve the
collection of personal data, and requires those businesses to give individuals greater visibility into, and
control over the data they provide to those
businesses. GDPR also provides greater protections for EU citizen data by imposing strict obligations on
data handling, while making businesses more
accountable for how they handle data. Very significant fines of up to €20,000,000 or 4% of global annual
turnover, whichever is greater, may be levied on
organisations who fail to meet their obligations with respect to handling data under GDPR.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">What SurveyPluto has done</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
Making continual adjustments and improvements to ensure we are best positioned to meet our legal
obligations, and to assist our customers to do likewise
is an integral part of how we operate on a daily basis. Our customer relationships along with the trust they
place in us, are at the very heart of our
business, and are never taken for granted. We see GDPR as affording us yet another opportunity to continue
our legacy of protecting customer data.
Outlined in this white paper are some specific aspects of our approach to GDPR.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">Security</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
As SurveyPluto continues to make the security of data entrusted to us a priority, and in light of GDPR, we
have included more detail on the specific
measures we have in place in our customer-facing Security Statement. Some highlights include the following:
</p>
<p class="cut-2">Access Control (Authentication and Authorization)</p>
<p class="cut-2">Single-Sign On support</p>
<p class="cut-2">Data Encryption at rest and in transit</p>
<p class="cut-2">Continuous Network and Security Monitoring</p>
<p class="cut-2">Vulnerability Management</p>
<p class="cut-2">Incident Response and Recovery</p>
<p class="cut-2">Security Awareness Training</p>
<p class="cut-2">Periodic Independent 3rd Party security reviews and penetration testing</p>
<p class="cut-2">Multiple data centers to guarantee a secure and highly available service at scale</p>
<p class="cut-2">
Select group of trusted security partners, to ensure our customers are always protected with the
best-in-class security ISO 27001 certified
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">Security incidents</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
Despite best practices and security standards, no service on the internet is impervious to risk of security
incidents. However, we have detailed security
incident policies and procedures in place and frequently review these procedures. We are committed to
keeping our customers fully informed of any matters
relevant to the security of their account and to providing customers with all the information necessary for
them to meet their own regulatory reporting
obligations under GDPR. SurveyPluto Enterprise customers can also monitor and understand user activity
across their account such as usage, activity,
surveys deployed, the number of responses collected, and more.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">International data transfers</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
Personal data can only be transferred outside of the EU to countries where the European Commission
determines there is "an adequate level of protection"
in place. There are currently 11 countries deemed by the European Commission to provide "an adequate level
of protection". For transfers of data to all
other countries, we are happy to offer most customers our Data Processing Addendum, incorporating the EU
Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses,
in order to meet their legal obligations for the transfer of data from the EU to all countries not covered
by an EU Commission adequacy finding. For more
information and to access our DPA .
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">Data centre</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
In addition to the initiatives highlighted above, we are aware that many of our customers with EU users and
EU affiliates would prefer that their data be
hosted in the EU, notwithstanding the methods for lawful data transfer that we provide.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">Updates to legal terms</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
In addition to the changes to our Privacy Policy, we have made changes to our customer-facing legal terms
(e.g. Master Services Agreement and Data
Processing Addendum and our website terms of use) to include GDPR clauses.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">Data minimisation and accuracy of your data</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
Data minimisation and accuracy of your dataPrivacy by design and privacy by default are an intrinsic part of
our product planning and development. One
example of how we can help customers address their obligations under GDPR while using SurveyPluto is through
the admin control panel. Through the control
panel your account administrator can edit, export, or delete any data collected from your customers and
employees.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">Data retention</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
We have company-wide data retention policies. Furthermore, we empower our customers to control their data
through their account. As long as your account
is active, you have full control over the specific types of data, and length of time you hold such data. For
example, you can delete a single individual
survey response from your account if required to do so, as long as you can identify the correct respondent.
These features are readily accessible to all
of our customers. We honour all deletions from an account, and after a short period of time (60 days), all
account data which has been expunged by you is
permanently deleted from our back-ups.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">Our employee training program</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
We pride ourselves on the exceptional completion rate for our employee GDPR training program. Our program is
designed to ensure all employees across
within the company understand the obligations on SurveyPluto and on our customers under GDPR. Data is our
business so we work hard to ensure our employees
are educated on best practices around treatment of data.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">Data Protection Officer</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
We have appointed a Data Protection Officer and they are responsible for all matters related to GDPR. The
DPO can be contacted through
<span class="surveypluto-com"><a href="https://surveypluto.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c8a7aeaea1aba1a9a488bbbdbabeadb1b8a4bdbca7e6aba7a5">[email&#160;protected]</a></span>.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">Sub-processors</h3>
<p class="cut-2">
No SaaS provider is fully self-sufficient and so use of trusted third parties is essential to maintain our
business. If you are located in the EU, we
provide a list of sub-processors who assist SurveyPluto in the provision of the services. In order to obtain
this list, please contact us.
