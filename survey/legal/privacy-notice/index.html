</p>
<h3 class="title-2">8. Privacy Shield Compliance</h3>
<p class="cut-2 pl40">
The EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks were designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the European Commission and Swiss
Administration, respectively, to provide companies on both sides of the Atlantic with a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when
transferring personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States in support of transatlantic commerce.
</p>
<p class="cut-2 pl40">
The historic judgment in Case C-311/18 Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland and Maximillan Schrems (Schrems II) on 16th July 2020 invalidated
the EU-US Privacy Shield framework, a framework that allows unrestricted transfers of personal data from the EU to certified US-based organisations that
have agreed to higher standards of data protection. Additionally, followed by the landmark Schrems II case on September 8, 2020, the Swiss Data Protection
Authority announced that it no longer considers the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield adequate for the purposes of transfers of personal data from Switzerland to
the U.S. However we undertake to contractually commit to transfer and process all of our Users' data in compliance with the Standard Contractual Clauses.
</p>
<h3 class="title-2">9. COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
<p class="cut-2 pl40">
When it comes to collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts
parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of
websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
</p>

Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins, collect PII from children under 13? Our services and website are not intended to target
children under 13 years of age("Minor"). Neither do we specifically market and allow Minors to register with us nor knowingly collect Personal Information

</p>
<p class="cut-2 pl40">We do not sell your Personal Information</p>
<p class="cut-2 pl40">
The CCPA requires businesses to disclose whether they sell Personal Information. SurveyPluto does not sell your Personal Information. This means that we
do not rent, disclose, release, transfer, make available or otherwise communicate that personal information to a third party for monetary or other
